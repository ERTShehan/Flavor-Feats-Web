        <p>Things to love about this guy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy. Very easy.</li>
          <li>Creamy and rich.</li>
          <li>Freshness brought to you by spring vegetables.</li>
          <li>Vegetarian (as I did here) or add bacon (as mom does)</li>
          <li>Special-feeling, but not overly fancy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you don’t know (but I know you do), ALDI is my favorite. It’s the
          grocery store with the world’s most passionate fan club (present!)
          thanks to its affordable prices, sustainability initiatives, and LOTS
          OF ORGANIC OPTIONS.
        </p>

        <p>My personal ALDI faves for spring:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simply Nature Organic Grade A Cage Free Large Brown Eggs</li>
          <li>Simply Nature Organic Spinach</li>
          <li>Mushrooms and asparagus</li>
          <li>
            And my favorite cheese of all time – the Emporium Selection
            Specialty Shredded Cheese Gouda (I also love the Gruyere and Swiss
            blend which we used in this brunch bake)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Making The Quiche</h4>
        <p>Pie crust: check.</p>
        <p>
          I like to bake mine for about ten minutes first to get it partially
          baked, so the bottom of the quiche doesn’t get soggy.
        </p>

        <p>Filling: check check.</p>
        <p>Sauteed veggies, eggs, cream, salt, cheese… in you go.</p>

        />

        <p>And that’s it!</p>
        <p>
          Bake that little miracle right up and you’ve got yourself a happy
          springtime brunch that feels both special and down to earth at the
          same time. Will you be serving the new orange or pineapple mimosas
          from ALDI with your brunch? I mean… you tell me.

        <h4>What To Serve With This Quiche</h4>
        <p>
          This quiche is perfect alongside a nice little green salad, or
          something heartier like a springy grain salad. <br />

          Since this is vegetarian, if you wanted to add meat, this would be
          excellent with some bacon on the side! But, like, what isn’t made
          better with bacon on the side?<br />

          Brunch on!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
          <li>2 cups veggies – I used mushrooms, asparagus, and spinach</li>
          <li>8 Simply Nature Organic Grade A Cage Free Eggs</li>
          <li>1 1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 cup Emporium Selection Specialty Shredded Gouda Cheese</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt (more to taste)</li>
          <li>2 unbaked Bakehouse Creations Pie Crust</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Melt the butter over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms; sauté
            until browned and soft. Add the shallots; sauté until fragrant. Add
            asparagus; sauté until softened and bright green. Season with a
            pinch of salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk eggs and heavy cream together. Add cooked veggies, cheese, and
            salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press pie crust into a 10-inch pie pan and gently crimp the edges so
            they look nice. (This recipe is enough for two quiches, so just do
            this twice if you’re making both at the same time.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Poke tiny holes in the bottom of
            the crust with a fork. Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes, until
            partially baked.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the egg and veggie mixture into the pie dish (stop when you
            start to get to the top of the pie edges). Bake for 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove pan from oven and cover the pie edges with a foil crown so
            the edges don’t overbrown. Bake for another 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice and serve! Serve with a little spring mix salad, fruit, or
            muffins for brunch goals. Yum.
          </li>
        </ol>
