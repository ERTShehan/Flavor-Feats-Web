        <p>
          Pol Roti is incredibly versatile and pairs wonderfully with a variety
          of accompaniments, making it a popular choice for breakfast, snacks,
          or even as a side dish. Traditionally, it is served with lunu miris, a
          spicy onion and chili relish that adds a kick to the mild sweetness of
          the bread. Pol Roti also complements rich Sri Lankan curries,
          balancing their bold flavors with its subtle coconut taste.
          Additionally, many people enjoy it with a simple cup of tea, relishing
          the combination of the bread's warm, soft interior and the crunchy
          exterior. This beloved flatbread, cherished for its simplicity and
          comforting qualities, is a staple in many Sri Lankan homes and
          continues to be enjoyed by generations of food lovers.

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups wheat flour (or all-purpose flour)</li>
          <li>
            1 cup freshly grated coconut (or desiccated coconut, rehydrated)
          </li>
          <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional, for added flavor)</li>
          <li>
            1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional, for a spicy kick)
          </li>
          <li>1 sprig curry leaves, finely chopped (optional, for aroma)</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup water (approximately, adjust as needed)</li>
          <li>2-3 tablespoons oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <h5>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, grated coconut, chopped
            onion, green chilies, curry leaves (if using), and salt.
          </li>
          <li>Mix the ingredients well until evenly distributed.</li>
          <li>
            Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into
            a soft, pliable dough. The dough should not be too sticky or too
            dry. Adjust the water or flour as needed.
          </li>
          <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 2: Shape the Roti</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Divide the dough into 6-8 equal-sized portions, depending on how
            large you want the rotis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it slightly with your
            palms.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out each
            ball into a thin, round flatbread (about 1/4 inch thick).
            Alternatively, you can flatten it by hand for a more rustic look.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 3: Cook the Roti</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat a skillet or flat pan over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Lightly grease the pan with a little oil or ghee.</li>
          <li>
            Place one roti on the hot pan and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until
            small bubbles appear on the surface and the bottom turns golden
            brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip the roti and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes,
            pressing gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a little more oil or ghee around the edges of the roti for extra
            crispiness, if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the roti from the pan and place it on a plate. Repeat the
            process with the remaining dough.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 4: Serve</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serve the Pol Roti warm with your favorite accompaniments, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Lunu Miris (a spicy onion and chili relish)</li>
              <li>Coconut Sambol</li>
              <li>Curry (chicken, fish, or dhal curry)</li>
              <li>Honey or treacle (for a sweet version)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips for Perfect Pol Roti:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fresh Coconut: Use freshly grated coconut for the best flavor and
            texture. If using desiccated coconut, soak it in warm water for 10
            minutes to rehydrate before using.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust Thickness: Roll the roti thin for a crispier texture or
            slightly thicker for a softer bite.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customize the Flavors: Add finely chopped vegetables like carrots or
            leeks for a twist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the Dough Soft: If the dough becomes dry while rolling,
            sprinkle a little water and knead it again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook on Medium Heat: Avoid high heat, as it may burn the roti before
            it cooks through.
          </li>
        </ol>
