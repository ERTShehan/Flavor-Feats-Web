        <h4>What Makes Sri Lankan Chicken Curry Unique?</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Layered Spices: The curry is built on a foundation of whole spices
            like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, which are toasted to release
            their essential oils. These are complemented by ground spices like
            turmeric, chili powder, and Sri Lankan roasted curry powder,
            creating a complex flavor profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Coconut Milk: The use of coconut milk adds a creamy, luxurious
            texture and a subtle sweetness that balances the heat from the
            spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Curry Leaves: Fresh curry leaves are a signature ingredient in Sri
            Lankan cooking. They add a distinct, earthy aroma that is
            unmistakable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slow Cooking: The chicken is simmered slowly, allowing it to absorb
            all the flavors of the spices and coconut milk, resulting in tender,
            juicy meat that falls off the bone.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>For the Curry:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>1 cup thick coconut milk</li>
          <li>1 cup thin coconut milk (or water)</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice (optional, for tanginess)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the Spice Paste (Optional but Recommended):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
          <li>2-3 dried red chilies (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <h5>Step 1: Prepare the Spice Paste (Optional)</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Dry roast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, black
            peppercorns, and dried red chilies in a pan over low heat until
            fragrant (about 2-3 minutes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Grind the roasted spices into a fine powder using a spice grinder or
            mortar and pestle. Set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 2: Marinate the Chicken</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Clean the chicken pieces and pat them dry.</li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix the chicken with turmeric powder, chili powder,
            roasted curry powder, and the freshly ground spice paste (if using).
            Add a pinch of salt and mix well. Let it marinate for at least 30
            minutes (or overnight for deeper flavor).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 3: Cook the Curry</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oil in a large pot or pan over medium heat.</li>
          <li>
            Add mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds (if using). Let them splutter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Sauté for a few
            seconds until aromatic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chopped onions, green chilies, garlic, ginger, and curry
            leaves. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown and fragrant.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 4: Brown the Chicken</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes,
            stirring occasionally, until the chicken is lightly browned on all
            sides.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 5: Simmer the Curry</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pour in the thin coconut milk (or water) and stir well. Bring to a
            gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked
            through and tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 6: Add Thick Coconut Milk</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Once the chicken is cooked, add the thick coconut milk. Stir well
            and simmer for another 5-7 minutes on low heat. Do not boil
            vigorously after adding the thick coconut milk, as it may curdle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste and adjust salt and spice levels if needed. Add lime or lemon
            juice for a tangy kick (optional).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Step 7: Finish and Serve</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove the curry from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow
            the flavors to meld.
          </li>
          <li>Garnish with fresh curry leaves if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips for the Best Sri Lankan Chicken Curry:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use Bone-In Chicken: Bone-in chicken adds more flavor to the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fresh Coconut Milk: Freshly extracted coconut milk gives the curry a
            rich, creamy texture. If using canned coconut milk, mix it well
            before adding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roasted Curry Powder: Sri Lankan roasted curry powder is key to the
            authentic flavor. If unavailable, use a good-quality curry powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust Spice Levels: Control the heat by adjusting the amount of
            green chilies, chili powder, and dried red chilies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Low and Slow Cooking: Simmer the curry on low heat to allow the
            flavors to develop fully.
          </li>
        </ol>
