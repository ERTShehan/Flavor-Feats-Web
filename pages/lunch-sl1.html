        <p>
          Gotu Kola Sambol is a vibrant, refreshing, and nutritious Sri Lankan
          condiment that packs a punch of flavor and health benefits. It is made
          primarily with gotu kola leaves (Centella asiatica), a herb widely
          used in Asian cuisine and traditional medicine. These leaves are known
          for their slightly bitter, earthy taste and are rich in antioxidants,
          vitamins, and minerals. The sambol is a perfect balance of fresh,
          spicy, tangy, and savory flavors, making it a versatile accompaniment
          to rice, curry, or even bread.
        </p>

        <h4>What Makes Gotu Kola Sambol Special?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Freshness: The dish relies on fresh ingredients, especially the gotu
            kola leaves, which are finely chopped to release their flavor and
            nutrients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Texture: The combination of crunchy onions, tender gotu kola leaves,
            and the soft, creamy texture of grated coconut creates a delightful
            mouthfeel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flavor Profile: The sambol is a harmony of flavorsâ€”spicy from green
            chilies, tangy from lime or lemon juice, and savory from the coconut
            and onions. The optional garlic adds a subtle depth of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Health Benefits: Gotu kola is revered for its medicinal properties,
            including improving circulation, boosting brain function, and
            promoting skin health. This sambol is not just delicious but also a
            powerhouse of nutrition.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups finely chopped gotu kola leaves (washed and cleaned)</li>
          <li>1 small red onion or shallot, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice</li>
          <li>1/4 cup freshly grated coconut (or desiccated coconut)</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon chili powder (optional, for extra spice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Prepare the Gotu Kola Leaves:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wash the gotu kola leaves thoroughly under running water to
                remove any dirt or debris.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pat them dry and finely chop the leaves. You can also bruise the
                leaves slightly with a mortar and pestle to release their
                flavor.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Combine the Ingredients:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, add the chopped gotu kola leaves, finely
                chopped red onion, green chilies, and minced garlic (if using).
              </li>
              <li>Add the freshly grated coconut and mix everything well.</li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Season the Sambol:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Drizzle the lime or lemon juice over the mixture. This not only
                adds tanginess but also helps prevent the gotu kola from
                oxidizing and turning brown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sprinkle salt, black pepper, and chili powder (if using). Mix
                thoroughly to ensure all the ingredients are evenly coated.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Taste and Adjust:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Taste the sambol and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add
                more lime juice for tanginess, salt for savoriness, or chilies
                for heat.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Serve:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Transfer the sambol to a serving bowl. It is best served fresh
                to retain its vibrant flavors and textures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pair it with steamed rice, curry, roti, or even as a topping for
                toast.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a more authentic flavor, use freshly grated coconut instead of
            desiccated coconut.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of green chilies and chili powder according to
            your spice preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gotu Kola Sambol is best served fresh but can be stored in the
            refrigerator for up to a day.
          </li>
        </ul>
