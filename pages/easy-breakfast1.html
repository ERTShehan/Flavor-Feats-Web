        <h3>Swedish Pancakes</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s get right down to it: Swedish pancakes are delightful. This
          recipe will give you Swedish pancakes that are golden, buttery, chewy
          and thick enough to sink your teeth into in the middle, but thin
          enough to give you a signature Swedish pancake thin and lacy edge.
          It’s like something between an American pancake and a French crepe.
          Topped with lingonberry jam and yogurt, or whipped cream, or just
          straight cream?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ugh. I love them. This has been my go-to recipe and method for years!

        <h3>How To Make Swedish Pancakes</h3>
        <h4>Step 1: Make your batter.</h4>
        <p>I do this in a blender to get the eggs extra fluffed up.</p>
        <img
          src="/images/Swedish Pancakes3.png"
          alt="batter photo"
          style="width: 450px; height: 350px"
        />

        <h4>Step 2: Pour it in and give the pan a little tilt.</h4>
        <p>
          Pour the batter into the pan, and immediately give it a slight tilt so
          the batter spreads wider to create a thinner edge. I recommend holding
          both the blender to pour, AND the handle of the pan at the same time
          so you can almost do this simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this stresses you out, you don’t have to do this at all – you could
          just fry up the Swedish pancakes as-is and they’d be a bit thicker
          around the edges and still delicious. The only reason for the slight
          pan tilt is that it creates that signature Swedish pancake thin and
          lacy edge that is delightful to eat!
        </p>

          This example photo is off-heat, but you can see the effect of a pan
          tilt here. This is generally what you’re looking for:

          style="width: 450px; height: 350px"
        />

        <h4>Step 3: Cook and fold.</h4>
        <p>
          I like to go for a golden brown on the first side of my pancakes (1-2
          minutes).
        </p>
        <p>
          They are so thin that once the first side is cooked, you really only
          need 10-20 seconds on the back side.
