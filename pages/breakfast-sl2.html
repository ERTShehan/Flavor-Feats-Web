          <p>Here's a recipe for Hoppers (Appa):</p>
          <h4>Ingredients for Hoppers:</h4>
          <h5>For the Batter:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut milk (fresh or canned)</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (adjust as needed)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fermented rice water (optional, adds extra flavor)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coconut oil (for greasing)</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>For Cooking:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Coconut oil or vegetable oil for greasing the pan</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Prepare the Batter:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, all-purpose
                  flour (if using), sugar, salt, and instant yeast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gradually add warm water, mixing continuously, until you form
                  a smooth, thick batter. The batter should be pourable but not
                  too runny.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the coconut milk to the batter and mix well to combine.
                  The coconut milk will add a rich, creamy flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ferment the batter: Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let
                  the batter ferment for at least 4-6 hours, or overnight if
                  possible. The batter should rise and have a slightly tangy
                  smell once fermented.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Prepare the Hopper Pan:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you have a hopper pan (appa pan), place it over medium heat
                  to preheat. If you don’t have one, you can use a small, round
                  non-stick frying pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lightly grease the inside of the pan with a little coconut oil
                  or vegetable oil using a brush or a paper towel.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Cook the Hoppers:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Once the pan is heated, pour a ladleful of the batter into the
                  center of the pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Swirl the pan gently to spread the batter evenly around the
                  edges, forming a bowl shape. The center should remain thicker,
                  while the edges will be thin and crispy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cover the pan with a lid and cook for about 2-3 minutes, until
                  the edges become golden brown and crispy, while the center
                  remains soft and fluffy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you like an egg hopper (a variation where an egg is added
                  to the center), crack an egg into the center of the hopper
                  after pouring the batter. Cover and let it cook for 2-3
                  minutes, or until the egg is cooked to your liking.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Serve:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Carefully remove the hopper from the pan and place it on a
                  plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Serve immediately with Pol Sambal, Sri Lankan Dhal Curry,
                  Katta Sambal, or even a simple chili paste.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Tips:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you want crispy edges, ensure that the batter is spread thinly
              around the pan and that the pan is hot before adding the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
              For extra flavor, you can add a little fermented rice water (if
              available), which will give the hoppers a unique tangy taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Egg Hoppers (Biththara Appa) are very popular. Simply crack an egg
              into the center once the batter has been poured and let it cook
              with the lid on until the egg is cooked to your preference.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you don’t have a hopper pan, a small non-stick pan can be used,
              but a dedicated hopper pan will give you the best results for the
              shape and texture.
            </li>
          </ul>
