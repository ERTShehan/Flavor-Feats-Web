            <p>
              String Hoppers (Idiyappam) with Coconut Sambal is a beloved Sri
              Lankan breakfast or dinner dish. It's light, nutritious, and
              packed with flavor. The string hoppers are made from rice flour,
              and the coconut sambal adds a spicy and tangy kick that pairs
              perfectly with the soft, steamed noodles.

              Hoppers (Appa) are a popular and delicious Sri Lankan breakfast or
              dinner dish, known for their crispy edges and soft, fluffy center.
              They are made from a fermented rice flour batter and are typically

              Springy Vegetable Quiche! Fresh sautéed spring vegetables with
              creamy and cheesy eggs, all baked into a flaky pie crust. Easiest
              fancy-feeling brunch!
            </p>
            <p>
              Spring is the season of bright and hopeful feelings and wonderful,
              amazing brunch food. When we have brunch with my family, for sure
              the brunch item that will be for surely on the menu is my mom’s
              quiche. For sure. This quiche is a family favorite. One of my main
              issues with quiche is the texture, but this one has the texture
              just right: fluffy but not overly firm, creamy but not soggy, and
              full of flavorful sautéed veggies while still feeling like a
              proper savory-pie-for-breakfast moment. I tweaked a few things
              from my mom’s recipe for simplicity and personal preference, but
              what you see here is more or less her staple quiche recipe.
              Without fail, this very familiar, very beloved quiche shows up in
              our lives multiple times during the spring months thanks to my
              lovely mom and my hungry family who raves about this
              brunch-baked-into-a-pie situation.

              My go-to recipe for Swedish pancakes! Buttery, tender, and thick
              enough to sink your teeth into but with a nice thin, delicate,
              lacy edge.
